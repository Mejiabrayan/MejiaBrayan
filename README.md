# Hi, nice to meet you! 👋

🎓 I am, Brayan Mejia Cuenca, an aspiring Front End Web Developer and Javascript wizard 🪄 . I am also pursuing my Associates in Computer Science and plan on graduating in 2023.

🤓 I'm what you call a computer nerd, a thinker, a practitioner. More notably, I am an overall self-learner, I taught myself everything I know about programming through books (Javascript & Jquery by Jon Duckett started it all😏) and taking advantage of free online resources. Learning new technologies is what excite me, it's what I'm passionate about, being at the forefront of innovation and education which is programming and software.

📚 Outside of tech, I enjoy learning new skills that help push myself, and trying different hobbies like surfing and playing classical guitar - even baking! I'm also a big fan of reading books on self-development and financial literacy. My favorite ones are The Magic of Thinking Big by *David J. Schwartz* on self-improvement and The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by *John C. Bogle* in the genre of financial literacy.
